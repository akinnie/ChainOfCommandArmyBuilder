# Chain of Command Army Builder

## Andrew Kinnie

A sample app written in the Swift programming language.  The app is specifically targeted at a user who is a player of the game "Chain of Command" by [Too Fat Lardies](https://toofatlardies.co.uk/product-category/chain-of-command/) 

Initial MVP is to provide the user a means to create forces for a game, and will be drawing off data in json format bundled with the app, and based on the data in the rulebook for the default forces in the book for the different nationalities.  

- Subsequent versions could: 
  - add other force options from other "Pint Sized Campaigns" or 
  - have the user provide their own custom forces.  
  - The app could also load external json files and use those as additional options.
